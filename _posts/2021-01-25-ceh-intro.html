<h2>What is Hacking?</h2>
<p>
    Most non-technical people I talk to about <i>hacking</i> typically imagine some movie or TV show they've seen where
    some person with 14 monitors and 6 keyboards is trying to <i>hack</i> into a bank, federal institution
    or similar.
    Something like this:
    <img src="/img/posts/hacking-meme.jpg" style="width: 1000px; height: 750px"/>
    When it's more realistically just someone with a laptop, or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot">Mr
    Robot's</a> case, something like this:
    <img src="/img/posts/mr-robot.jpg" style="width: 1000px; height: 750px"/>
    Side note, if you haven't watched Mr. Robot you should, it's a pretty good show. Hacking has also been used as a sort
    of verb to describe quickly putting together code for a project or to hot fix a bug. You've probably heard the term
    "Hackathon", which is usually just a competition or meet up for developers to quickly put together a working piece
    of software in a small amount of time. From a security standpoint though, hacking is simply <u>gaining unauthorized access
    to a system or computer without permission.</u>
</p>

<h2>What is (Certified) Ethical Hacking?</h2>
<p>
    Ethical hacking (sometimes referred to as white hat) is when someone attempts to gain access to a system
    <u>with permission</u> of the system owner in an attempt to expose vulnerabilities in their security. However, the
    tools to perform illegal hacking and ethical hacking are typically the same. Organizations will actually pay security
    consultants to break into their system so that they can close those gaps and holes in their security. You can actually
    obtain an official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Ethical_Hacker">CEH</a> certification similar
    to getting AWS, Azure, GCP and other technical certifications. It's a pretty good certificate to have, especially if
    you want to go into the security field. The best way to know how to defend a system from an attack is to know how
    someone will attempt to attack you as well as the common vulnerabilities across systems, networking and the social
    engineering aspect.
</p>

<h2>Getting Setup</h2>
<p>
    I don't have a heavy background in security but I've always been interested in learning more. I know a decent amount
    about networking and common operating systems but I'd never actually attempted to <i>hack</i> into something of mine.
    So I went on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> and found a decent intro course to Ethical Hacking. At first,
    I just watched and took notes on the lectures to get the general theory and methods behind the different attacks but
    after a while I had to try some of them on myself! I installed
    <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a> as a VM in <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. Kali
    Linux comes preinstalled with a lot of penetration attacks, spoofing attacks and common tools for breaching security.
    All of the tools could be used on other Linux machines as they are readily available in most package managers but the
    easiest way to get started is to just use an updated Kali. I also went the extra step to purchase a external Wi-Fi
    adapter as they're typically better than the built-in cards and are easier to use on a VM. In the end I had everything
    up and running in less than an hour (except for waiting on the Wi-Fi adapter in the mail), it really didn't take long.
</p>

<h2>How I cracked my Wi-Fi password in less than a second</h2>
<p>
    The first thing I wanted to try out was attempting to gain access to my Wi-Fi network in my virtual machine. My Wi-Fi
    , as most do these days, uses WPA2 as it's encryption standard and PSK (Pre-Shared Keys). While this is a relatively
    secure standard, there is a major known vulnerability with WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) on routers if configured
    incorrectly. If you've ever pushed the button on your router and then on another wireless device without
    having to enter a password, you've used WPS, specifically Push-Button WPS. There's another flavor of WPS, the PIN version,
    which is always on and essentially allows access to the network with a "secret" WPS pin. The WPS PIN is an 8 digit number
    that can be used to connect to the router without
    having to enter in the Wi-Fi password. The problem with this is that it can be relatively easily brute forced as there
    are only 10^8 possibilities. It's actually less than 10^8 because the EAP-NACK messages allow the attacker to know
    if the first 4 digits are correct. To add on top of that, the last digit of the PIN is a checksum value, so instead
    of 10^8 possibilities, there's only 10^4 + 10^3 or roughly 11,000 attempts needed to gain access. To add a little
    cherry on top for attackers as well, a lot of WPS PINs across manufactures have a common default, such as '00000000'
    or similar.
</p>>
<p>
    So, of course, there are common tools that can be used to exploit this WPS vulnerability. The one I used on my personal
    network is called <a href="https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x">reaver</a> combined with a tool called
    <a href="https://en.kali.tools/?p=341">wash</a>. With my external Wi-Fi adapter so close to my router I was easily
    able to capture the <i>encrypted</i> data sent on my own home network. The wash tool allows me to scan my network
    to verify if WPS is enabled and to my dismay it was (it is for most default router configurations). Even more so, my
    router had PIN mode enabled and not just Push Button. I switched my Wi-Fi adapter to the 2.4Ghz channel my router was on
    and began to use the reaver tool to attempt to crack the pin and discover my Wi-Fi password in plaintext.
    The command looks something like <code>reaver -i wlan0mon -b 00:11:22:33:44:55 -vv -d 3 -N -L â€“c 11</code>. You can
    look at what these options mean in the documentation, but the gist of it is I specified my external wireless adapter
    interface to <i>attack</i> the MAC address (my router) to attempt to brute force the correct WPS Pin. And, in less
    than a second my Wi-Fi password was printed on my terminal in plaintext! There's another way to attempt to break the
    WPS PIN in an offline attack called pixie-dust, which typically comes as another option in tools like reaver or bully.
</p>

<h2>Hacking Myself Continued</h2>
<p>
    Since then I've totally disabled WPS on my router and would suggest you do the same. Some routers employ a lock out where
    after a few failed attempts it will lock out for a specific period of time or until manually turned back on. For fun
    I also used <a href="https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng">airodump-ng</a> to capture the WPA2 handshake
    on my network which I caused by using <a href="https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng">aireplay-ng</a> to
    deauthenticate my phone for a short amount of time from the network so that it had to reconnect. During the reconnect
    it performs the WPA2 handshake which can be captured. Once you capture this handshake you can brute force password attempts
    against it with <a href="https://www.aircrack-ng.org/">airecrack-ng</a> with a word list without any lockout since
    it is all happening locally on your machine. However as this is just somewhat randomly guessing the password it could
    take years to find the right one depending on the power of the machine and the strength of the password. Since I know
    my Wi-Fi password I used <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/crunch-wordlist/">crunch</a> to generate a few thousand
    passwords that had my password somewhere in it. Since it was only a few thousand it cracked it in a few seconds using
    the wordlist and again I was presented my Wi-Fi password.
</p>
<p>
    From there I went on to perform some man in the middle attacks
    on myself using ARP spoofing, then bypassed (some) HTTPS by using <a href=https://www.bettercap.org/">bettercap</a>
    with ssl strip, which attempts to downgrade all HTTPS connections to HTTP so the data can be read unencrypted. Not
    all sites are vulnerable to this because they use HSTS, which can be worked around in a way that is unlikely to work
    for the average person. Then I went on to do some DNS spoofing with a little custom website I made, played with some
    JavaScript injection. That's just scratching the surface really and just relying on existing tools to do the heavy
    lifting. The best thing I got out of everything so far though is the theory and ideas behind the attacks as the tools
    and security standards will change over time but a lot of the principles will stay the same. I'm sure I probably explained
    some of this incorrectly and left a lot of info out but I'm relatively new to it and hope to eventually go on to learn
    enough to take as well as pass the CEH exam.
