<h2>Integration Testing</h2>
<p>
    This post is about integration testing, as opposed to unit testing. Unit testing is obviously extremely important,
    however integration testing is also very important to have confidence in your system as whole. For brevity, integration testing is
    testing the system/component/application as a cohesive group. This differs from unit testing because you are testing
    everything together rather than individual "units" of logic. For example, you may have a method that performs an
    encryption algorithm on some set of data. You would typically write a unit test that tests only this functionality;
    given input data, you expect encrypted output data. For the integration test for this hypothetical application you
    may write a test that sends a POST request to an REST API endpoint to create a user. This POST request will trigger
    the encryption method on the user password before storing it in the database. The integration test may verify that
    the user was created correctly in the database which would test that the full user creation process is working
    correctly. However to truly test this you would need a database to use for the test and ideally this database is
    very similar to the live application's database. You could use an in memory database such as <a href="https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html">H2</a>
    for Java, a database running on some development server or you could mock the interaction of the database because you assume the database
    will function how it is supposed to because it isn't software that you've written. Another option that I like (for
    the most part) is using a <a href=https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> container for the database. When done correctly,
    utilizing a container with a database running in it will allow your tests to not affect other tests that need to use a
    database, unlike a common development server database might.

<h2>Testing With Containers</h2>
<p>
    My experience with writing tests against programmatically created Docker containers is mainly with Java as well as
    a little bit of C# specifically with database containers so that is what I will use as reference here.
    However the same concepts could be used in other
    languages and there are probably similar libraries that already exist in popular languages. Testing with containers
    is certainly not limited to using database containers. In Java there is an open
    source library for <i>easy</i> programmatic testing called <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">testcontainers</a>.
    An example of creating a container for a test with Postgres Junit5 would be something like:
    <pre>
        @Testcontainers
        class MixedLifecycleTests {

            // will be started before and stopped after each test method
            @Container
            private PostgreSQLContainer postgresqlContainer = new PostgreSQLContainer()
                .withDatabaseName("foo")
                .withUsername("foo")
                .withPassword("secret");

            @Test
            void test() {
                assertTrue(postgresqlContainer.isRunning());
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <br/>
    As you can see it is fairly simple to setup. There is a lot more too it as well if you want to dive in such as setting
    up SQL scripts to run when the database is created, specifying exposed ports, networks, mounted volumes... basically
    anything you would typically want to do with a Docker container. They also support running Docker Compose scripts and even the Docker
    wormhole pattern, meaning using Docker in Docker. This would typically occur if your build process is itself already running
    in a Docker container, such as using a GitLab agent that uses a Docker container for the builds or running Jenkins itself
    in a Docker container.
</p>

<p>
    Setting up your tests to use Docker containers like this allows them to typically always behave the same and
    will more closely mimic the real, live system that the application is being used in. To me, this gives me greater
    confidence when I push this change to the development, staging or even production server that it will work properly.
    This shouldn't take away from the need for moving releases through various stages of live systems (such as dev/stage/production)
    however it is very useful for providing a way to test things in a realistic way on local developer's machines. All they
    need to install is Docker typically and they're ready to go.

<h2>Drawbacks to Container Testing</h2>
<p>
    While there are some great benefits to using containers for testing, there can be some drawbacks. Such as container
    start up time, Docker differences between Windows and Linux/MacOS, networking issues on build servers and more. For me
    one drawback is that I have the (unfortunate) need to use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2">IBM DB2</a>
    databases for testing. For this specific container it can take up to 2-4 minutes to start the container and get the
    database running. Now if you have 50 tests running and you want a separate clean database for each test than that would
    mean 100-200 minutes of test container creation. To get around this unfortunate start up time I combine all tests that
    don't modify the database to use the same container. You could also optionally setup your test to restore the database
    to the original state it was in before it completes. For instance, if your test is doing a delete on a table then after
    it is finished it will restore this table. This strategy would allow the use of the same container for tests however
    it doesn't always make sense for the test and it hardly differs from just hosting the database on some development server
    and using that one (aside from working well on developer's local machines).
