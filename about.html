<p>I'm a father to two amazing daughters. I'm a software engineer by profession.</p>

<p>In my little free time outside my family and work life I'm usually hacking together personal projects, playing video games or enjoying a fine whiskey.</p>

<p>I decided not to include any sort of portfolio on the site at this point. At the bottom of the page(s) you can click the GitHub or LinkedIn icons for
navigating to my respective profile there. If you feel so inclined you can also email me using the other icon below.</p>
